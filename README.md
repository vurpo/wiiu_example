# Wii U homebrew example using wut and GLSL compiler

Based on the gx2 example code from the wut repo, but modified to use this new GLSL compiler and to use GLSL shaders. See https://github.com/devkitPro/wut readme for how to compile their samples.

Requires the compiler from https://github.com/Exzap/CafeGLSL to function (see the "Usage" section in their readme). Not tested on real hardware (yet).
